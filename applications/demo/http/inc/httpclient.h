/**
 * @addtogroup HttpClient
 * @{
 * HttpClient API implements the client-side of HTTP/1.1. It provides base interfaces to execute an HTTP request on a given URL. It also supports HTTPS (HTTP over TLS) to provide secure communication.\n
 * @section HttpClient_Usage_Chapter How to use this module
 * In this release, MediaTek provides two types of APIs: high level APIs and low level APIs.\n
 * - \b The \b high \b level \b APIs
 *  - Enables to execute a single HTTP request on a given URL.
 *  - Call #httpclient_get(), #httpclient_post(), #httpclient_put() or #httpclient_delete() to get, post, put or delete and HTTP request.\n
 * - \b The \b low \b level \b APIs
 *  - Enables to execute more than one HTTP requests during a Keep-Alive connection. Keep-alive is the idea of using a single TCP connection to send and receive multiple HTTP requests/responses, as opposed to opening a new connection for every single request/response pair.
 *  - Step1: Call #httpclient_connect() to connect to a remote server.
 *  - Step2: Call #httpclient_send_request() to send an HTTP request to the server.
 *  - Step3: Call #httpclient_recv_response() to receive an HTTP response from the server.
 *  - Step4: Repeat Steps 2 and 3 to execute more requests.
 *  - Step5: Call #httpclient_close() to close the connection.
 *  - Sample code: Please refer to the example under /project/mt7687_hdk/apps/http_client/http_client_keepalive folder.
